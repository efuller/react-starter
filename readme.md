# React Client

## Purpose
To dive more deeply into React and explore different techniques as well as the React API.

## What is the goal?
To create a starter client that will have the ability to have some base functionality like handle login/logout
against an API.

For now, this will be done only using React. Implementing Redux may come later or in a different library.

## API
This client is being built in conjunction with this API - https://github.com/efuller/express-api-starter
